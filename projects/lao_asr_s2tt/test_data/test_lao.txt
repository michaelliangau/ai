Hello, my name is Maly I was born in Laos, Ban Khantherng, Pakse city, Sedong province. I got married in 1958. I have 8 children, 2 died, still have 6 remaining, 2 live in Laos, 4 live in the US. Firstly I want to thank God for blessing us with having a good life, bringing us comfort and preventing us from living in poverty. Living in the US is really comfortable, we have food on our plates and roof over our head. All of this is because of God’s blessing. Everyone wants to come to the US because it is the best place to live because the US government takes care of refugees, they take care of everything from food to accommodation because of God’s blessing we get to live in a blissful place on Earth. I thank God for everything for helping Lao people that seek refuge to the US and I thank Mother and Father.
