# Denoising Diffusion Primitives

Text conditioned image diffusion model implementation in PyTorch.

Most of the code in this codebase is approapiate from the AssemblyAI MiniImagen tutorial. This was intended to be used as a purely education resource to understand the train and inference loop of text to image diffusion models.

`diffusion_model_dev.ipynb` is built from a tutorial and does not include text conditioning.
